# Oil Price Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting future oil prices using historical data and various machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a predictive model that can help stakeholders make informed decisions regarding investments, production, and market strategies.

## Project Overview
The project is divided into several key stages:

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Gathering historical oil price data from reliable sources.
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data, handling missing values, and performing necessary transformations.
  
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzing the data to understand trends, patterns, seasonality, and correlations.
- Visualizing the data using plots such as time series plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.

## Feature Engineering
- Creating new features that might help improve the predictive power of the model.
- Generating lag features, rolling statistics, and other derived features based on domain knowledge.
  
## Model Selection and Training
- Comparing different machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and LSTM) to determine which performs best on the data.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
  
## Model Evaluation
- Assessing model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.
  
## Prediction and Visualization
- Using the trained model to make future oil price predictions.
- Visualizing the predicted vs. actual prices to assess the accuracy of the model.
  
## Deployment
- Creating an API or a web-based dashboard to allow users to input new data and get real-time price predictions.
- Deploying the model using cloud services or containerization tools like Docker.

## How to Run the Project
1. # Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/oil-price-prediction.git
cd oil-price-prediction

2. # Prepare the data:
- Place your dataset in the data/ directory.
- Run the data preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

3. # Run the Jupyter notebooks:
Explore the data and build models using the provided notebooks in the notebooks/ directory.

4. # Train the model:
- Execute the training scripts in the src/ directory to train your selected model.

5. # Make predictions:
- Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

6. # Deploy the model:
- Optionally, deploy the model using Flask or Django to create a web-based prediction tool.

## Results
The final model's performance will be evaluated based on various metrics, and the results will be presented in terms of accuracy, error rates, and visual comparisons between actual and predicted prices.
